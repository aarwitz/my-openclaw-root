# Scripts Policy (Canonical)

This is the single source of truth for how scripts are organized, used, and
retired in `~/.openclaw`. Every agent and every human should follow it.

## Container model (why this matters)

- `~/.openclaw/scripts/` is **shared** across every OpenClaw agent. All agents
  (main, druck, dwight, resi, trader, …) run inside the **single
  `openclaw-gateway` container**, which bind-mounts the entire `~/.openclaw`
  tree. There is **no per-agent copy**.
- Other containers (`lidi-task-manager-autotap-agent-*`) do
  **not** mount `~/.openclaw`. They run app code, not OpenClaw ops scripts,
  and are explicitly **exempt** from this policy.
- Result: edits to a script in `~/.openclaw/scripts/` take effect for every
  agent immediately. The risk is bloat, drift, and untraced ad-hoc work — this
  policy is the control.

## Registry

`~/.openclaw/scripts/policy.json` is the source of truth for **which
directories are governed**. The lint, audit, and scaffolder all read it.

- `governedDirs[]` — directories whose `.sh`/`.py` files MUST source the
  wrapper guard.
- `exemptDirs[]` — documented out-of-scope directories (e.g. app code in
  isolated containers).
- `exemptScripts[]` — individual files that legitimately cannot self-guard
  (currently only the wrapper itself).

To add a new governed directory: edit `policy.json`, then run the lint.

Prompt/config generators and operator docs must follow the same rule. If a
file shows a runnable command for a governed script, the example must use
`run-with-trace.sh`; do not teach direct `python3`, `bash`, or raw-path
invocation for governed entries.

## Mandatory wrapper

Every governed `.sh` / `.py` file must begin with the wrapper guard:

```bash
# bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
source "/home/aaron/.openclaw/scripts/lib/require-wrapper.sh"
set -euo pipefail
```

```python
# python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, "/home/aaron/.openclaw/scripts/lib")
from require_wrapper import require_wrapper
require_wrapper()
```

The guard auto-reexecs through `run-with-trace.sh` by default, which writes a
JSONL trail to `~/.openclaw/logs/script-runs.jsonl`. If
`OPENCLAW_REQUIRE_WRAPPER_NO_AUTORUN=1` is set, direct invocation is rejected
with exit `126` instead.

## Running scripts

```bash
~/.openclaw/scripts/run-with-trace.sh <script> [args...]
~/.openclaw/scripts/run-with-trace.sh --tag <category> <script> [args...]
```

Common tags: `manual`, `audit`, `hook`, `cron`, `verify`, `test`.

## Day-to-day commands

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Create a new governed script | `~/.openclaw/scripts/new-script.sh <name>.{sh,py} [target-dir]` |
| Lint (enforce wrapper coverage) | `~/.openclaw/scripts/scripts-policy-lint.sh` |
| Weekly lint runner (for cron) | `~/.openclaw/scripts/cron-scripts-policy-lint.sh` |
| Bloat inventory report | `~/.openclaw/scripts/run-with-trace.sh --tag audit ~/.openclaw/scripts/audit_script_inventory.py --stale-days 45` |
| JSON inventory (for automation) | `… audit_script_inventory.py --stale-days 45 --json` |

The scaffolder bakes in the wrapper guard automatically. Prefer it over hand-
written boilerplate so new scripts never drift from the policy.

## Scheduled enforcement

Weekly lint is installed in user crontab:

```cron
17 3 * * 0 /home/aaron/.openclaw/scripts/run-with-trace.sh --tag cron /home/aaron/.openclaw/scripts/cron-scripts-policy-lint.sh >> /home/aaron/.openclaw/logs/cron-scripts-policy-lint.log 2>&1
```

What it does:

- Runs wrapper coverage lint through `run-with-trace.sh`.
- Appends trace records to `~/.openclaw/logs/script-runs.jsonl`.
- Writes a structured policy-audit line to `~/.openclaw/logs/script-audit.jsonl`.
- Returns non-zero when violations exist, so failures are visible in cron logs.

## Deletion rule

Do **not** delete based on age alone. Delete only when **all** are true:

1. Script is a `deletion_candidate` in the inventory (stale **and** zero
   external references).
2. Not referenced by active docs, config (`openclaw.json`), cron, or hooks.
3. No active operational owner depends on it.
4. A replacement exists, or the script is truly obsolete.

Always use the trace runner for the deletion attempt as well so the
retirement leaves a trail.

## Discoverability for agents

Each agent workspace's `TOOLS.md` includes a short "Scripts policy" section
pointing at this README. When an agent needs to run anything in
`~/.openclaw/scripts/` (or write a new helper), it should:

1. Use the scaffolder, never hand-write a new script.
2. Run scripts via `run-with-trace.sh`.
3. Refuse to run a governed script that is missing the wrapper guard; fix the
   script (or mark it exempt with a reason) first.
